# Billionaire SQL Analysis

* Despite modernization and economic growth, the gap between those with high net worths and the rest of society continues to grow. 
The richest 1% of individuals possess as much wealth as 6.9 billion people.  
* With Forbes reporting that billionaires added a staggering $1 trillion dollar aggregate increase in personal wealth during the pandemic, it is necessary to investigate who these individuals are and how they acquired their wealth.  
* This project analyzes, contextualizes and visualizes the Peterson Institute for International Economics' Billionaire Survey, one of the most comprehensive studies conducted on billionaire wealth acquisition.  
* Pandas was used to clean the dataset hosted in an SQL database, which was queried using SQL Lite and the resulting insights were visualized with Python's Seaborn Library.
